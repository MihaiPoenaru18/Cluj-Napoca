# Website about Cluj-Napoca 

I did a single page touristic website about Cluj-Napoca, using a template as a starting point.
I had a lot of fun displaying historical and geographical facts about the city, featuring my favorite pubs and restaurants, and offering an overview of its universities, all of these by means of CSS and HTML.
